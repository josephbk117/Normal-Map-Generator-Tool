Different view modes are available while editing the normal map :
1. Height map mode ( Gray scale )
2. Normal map mode
3. 3D Plane mode, Has lighting applied on top.

Realtime preview of the texture applied on a model can be shown as well.
This is a real-time preview of how the texture will look once applied on the model.
This preview mode has 3 modes:
1. Height map mode
2. Normal mode
3. Lighting mode
4. Textured mode, which combines lighting along with a custom diffuse texture.
